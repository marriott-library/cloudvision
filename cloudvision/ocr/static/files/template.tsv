A system is described which uses knowledge about the environment, sensors, and performance requirements to construct a functional configuration of sensors and algorithms. The system uses an object based approach to synthesize both the analytical model for an object and the executable application system.

Since the first years when computers became available to the scientific community, the idea of using the digital computer to enhance images has existed. Applications involving the extraction of meaningful information from images range from indus­trial robots that can act upon visual information to automated visual inspection of satellite photos [18,16). The recent boom in hardware speed and affordability has made it possible to apply more computer vision techniques in industry, which to date have had limited success. Industrial applications have an advantage over other computer vision applications since the environment in which they operate can be tightly constrained. They are usually specific vision systems with well defined tasks. A more general vision system such as that of humans would be of tremendous use in any environment, but current technology is far from achieving this capability. It is possible however to produce a highly sophisticated vision system which incorporates human knowledge about the application and tools available, which is a step towards the more general and powerful system desired. Computer Aided Design systems (CAD) are becoming readily available in present day manufacturing. They have greatly increased the speed and reliability of product design and manufacturing. CAD /CAM systems have the capability to operate machinery to create designed parts without human intervention. As

Experimental inspection systems have been developed which use a CAD model of an object to perform visual inspection [7,17). These systems either use the CAD representation for a part, images rendered from the CAD system, or camera images of the actual object. Systems which use information from the CAD model directly have the advantage of greater accuracy in their recognition and inspection methods. This interface between the vision system and the CAD system is a current topic of research and has brought to light the problems involved with the visual inspection and recognition of objects [13). This thesis will examine the use of CAD for computer vision applications. Automated visual inspection systems must meet certain requirements in speed, accuracy, and flexibility to be of any real use in the work environment [3]. There are several commercial 2D vision systems available using the SRI Vision Module [11]. 2D means that the system uses only two-dimensional features of an object from a controlled viewpoint. This immediately restricts the object's shape to be flat which is still of immense use in industrial applications. These systems are: Machine Intelligence Corporation's VS-100 system, Automatix's Autovision system, Unimation's Univision I, Control Automation's V-1000, Intelledex's V- 100 Robot Vision System, and Octek's Robot Vision Module. These systems must operate in tightly controlled environments since they depend on global features of objects such as area, perimeter, and diameter. They are comprised of sensors, software, and processors all tuned to a particular recognition or inspection task. Generally this means they have little or no flexibility to rapidly integrate new hardware and software or reconfigure themselves for a new application. Many components of vision systems could be re-used in other applications if the system were designed with enough modularity. Ultimately it would be desirable to have

This would give the system incredible flexibility of application, and provide for a highly modularized design. This thesis examines the creation of an environment which provides a virtual architecture for the design of vision application systems. It also explores automa­tion in the synthesis of such systems using a knowledge based approach. This approach uses human knowledge in the form of rules to configure and operate system software and has proven a powerful method for solving complex prob­lems [20]. A prototype vision system was designed which incorporates the use of a CAD based model with the knowledge based approach using information about the application, environment, hardware, and software to configure visual recognition systems. The performance of these systems is also examined.
